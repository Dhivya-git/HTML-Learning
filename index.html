                <p><em>Aspiring <strong>Software Engineer</strong></em></p>
            
                <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer keen to get back into IT. I am a creative individual
                    who finds developing software solutions immensely rewarding. I have been intrigued by
                    technologies for as long as I could remember and have always wanted to help create robust 
                    software systems using cutting edge technologies that help progress mankind. Helping with 
                    the advancement of humanity through technology, is something I am passionate about, which 
                    I think I can achieve being a software engineer.
                </p>
                <p>I have a Bachelor Of Engineering degree in Information Technology with a history of working 
                    for Cisco Offshore Development Centre, world leader in providing network solutions. I was 
                    recognised with SPARC award from HCL Technologies for achieving high level of customer 
                    satisfaction which shows my positive work ethics.
                </p>
                <p>The process of contributing to develop a software, then watching it flourish, I believe, 
                    is extremely rewarding. The best part of having a software engineering career for me 
                    seems to be the problem-solving aspect - I will face numerous challenges, but I will 
                    try to solve them utilising the knowledge and skills I have acquired previously and 
                    with the ones I am constantly learning, combined with my creativity and imagination.
                    I am always eager to learn new technologies and to utilize my knowledge to my highest 
                    ability. Eventually, I want to feel proud and satisfied on my performance wherever I work.
